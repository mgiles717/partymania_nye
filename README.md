I made a game for my friends for NYEs in Typescript and Svelte. I had no intention on making this professional or high quality at all, so please to do not examine with great detail. You can tell how serious I took it from the fact I didn't even put in a proper .gitignore.
Mainly just an experiment with Websockets, and full-stack Typescript using Node.js
